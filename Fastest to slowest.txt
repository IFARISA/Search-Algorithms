Sorted from Fastest to Slowest (on Average):

1- Quick Sort → O(n log n) (Fast in practice due to low constant factors)

2- Merge Sort → O(n log n) (Stable but requires extra space)

3- Heap Sort → O(n log n) (Less cache-friendly than Quick Sort)

4- Insertion Sort → O(n²) (Efficient for nearly sorted data, O(n) in best case)

5- Selection Sort → O(n²) (Slower than Insertion Sort in most cases)

6- Bubble Sort → O(n²) (One of the slowest; optimized versions exist)
